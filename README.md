Users of Picture Colorizer version 2.0 should be aware that that this product is intended for use by a computer with a web browser installed.
Web browsers developed on the Chromium project are recommended for use. The product uses the computer's system resources.
Editing large images can put a high load on the CPU, GPU, and RAM.
This product is not recommended for use by tablets and smartphones due to limited technical resources.
In cases of computer slowdown or processor/memory temperature rise, the user should close the web browser and wait for a few minutes.

USAGE
---------------------

The top right of the navigation menu contains links to sample images.
In the middle of the artboard, below the image container, there are buttons for inserting and uploading a custom image.
In the lower middle position are the image processing tool selection buttons.
By pressing the corresponding button, you select the tool. A small window appears in the upper left corner with the possible manipulations for the image.
Changes are made in real time, on the selected image. In the window of each tool there is a "reset" button, the purpose of which is to return the original state of the image. But this state is for changes made by the currently selected tool.
The "Preview" button opens a new tab in the web browser, opening the current image in full size. Note that this may result in using a large amount of system memory!
To close the review tab, in order to free up memory, it is advisable to use the "CLOSE" button below the image.
